# Order With Chart

*****DON'T FORGET TO TAKE THE LIBRARIES (JCommon, JFreeChart)*****

Homework from college/ Chau

Made in JAVA/ NetBeans.

This is a little homework from my college from a supposed chair factory.
What I needed to do is put the tasks in order and sum how many hours 
they will take to make that chair and then put it all in a chart.
